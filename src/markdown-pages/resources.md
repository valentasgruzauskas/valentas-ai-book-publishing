# Resources to learn practically

### 1) Hands-on AI & ML (build first)

* **[solveit.fast.ai](https://solveit.fast.ai/)** — A *paradigm* for learning to code *with* an LLM while staying in control: you steer the plan, verify outputs, and convert ideas into working, testable code.
* **[fast.ai — Machine Learning](https://course18.fast.ai/ml.html)** — Practical classic ML (tabular, trees, feature engineering); fastest path to useful business models.
* **[fast.ai — Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)** — Code-first deep learning with ready-to-run notebooks; build real models quickly.
* **[DAIR.AI (Thinkific)](https://dair-ai.thinkific.com/)** — Community-driven courses on NLP/LLMs, prompting, and modern AI workflows.
* **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** — Short, industry-aligned courses (LLMs, GenAI product skills, MLOps) to round out practice.
* **[Karpathy — Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)** — Implement neural nets from scratch; superb for intuition and under-the-hood understanding.
* **[fast.ai — Part 2](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html)** — From-scratch deep learning; re-build core components and sharpen internals.
* **[DeepLearning.AI — Mathematics for ML & Data Science](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/)** — Focused math to support the above courses (linear algebra, calculus, probability) with applied framing.

### 2) Core skills: math, Python & tooling — start here if you’re new to coding

* **[LinkedIn Learning — Getting Started with Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-with-python)** — A structured, beginner-friendly Python path.
* **[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)** — Interactive Git visualizations that make branching/merging click; essential for solo and team workflows.
* **[Khan Academy — AP Calculus BC: Differentiation (1)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-differentiation-1-new)** — Derivative fundamentals; ties directly to gradients in ML.
* **[Khan Academy — AP Calculus BC: Differentiation (2)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-differentiation-2-new)** — Advanced differentiation techniques; strengthens optimization intuition.
* **[Khan Academy — Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)** — Partial derivatives, gradients, vector calculus—useful for understanding training dynamics.

### 3) Safety, ethics & interpretability — bake this in early

* **[fast.ai — Ethics](https://ethics.fast.ai/)** — Curated readings and practices on bias, privacy, disinformation, and responsible deployment.
* **[Interpretable Machine Learning (Molnar)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)** — SHAP, LIME, partial dependence, and more—clear methods to explain models responsibly.
