Where would the funds go? I aim to become accredited to audit and certify AI systems under the EU’s emerging regime (ISO/IEC 17065). The total estimated cost is about €50,000, covering the full accreditation pathway—defining scope (for example, computer vision, LLMs), documenting processes, and independent expert review/verification. Licenses are typically granted for five years and may include audits of the organization; if no certifications are delivered within two years, the license can be revoked. Because the regulation and ecosystem are still evolving, investing personal capital carries real risk—especially for an individual expert.

To my knowledge in Lithuania, only a few organizations are exploring full accreditation; most plan to consult on implementation rather than perform audits. That could mean even well-prepared companies might need certification abroad (for example, in Germany or the UK), where costs are likely higher.

I intend to invest part of my own capital. Community support would make this markedly more feasible. As a simple illustration: 500 people contributing €100 each would cover €50,000. Any amount helps and will be directed to the accreditation pathway and its required expert reviews.
