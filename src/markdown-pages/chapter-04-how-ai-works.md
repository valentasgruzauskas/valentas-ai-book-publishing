4.1 Basics

AI systems are pattern finders. You give examples of inputs and desired outcomes; the system learns a rule that maps one to the other and then applies that rule to new cases. Think of it as a colleague that improves when you give clearer goals, representative examples, and feedback.

Key ideas

Data before models: better data beats fancier algorithms.

Train, validate, test: learn on one slice, tune on another, judge on a third you never touched.

Measure what the business cares about: time saved, errors avoided, revenue lifted, risk reduced.

Keep humans in the loop: low-confidence cases and edge scenarios should route to people.

4.2 Machine learning

Machine learning is software that learns rules from data rather than rules you write yourself.

Main modes

Supervised learning: learn from labeled examples (spam vs. not spam, invoice category).

Unsupervised learning: find structure without labels (cluster customers).

Reinforcement learning: learn by trial and error with rewards (operations policies, robotics).

Typical workflow

Collect and clean data

Choose features or representations

Train a model and tune it

Evaluate on unseen data

Deploy with monitoring, feedback, and retraining triggers

4.3 Algorithms you will actually meet

Simple, reliable workhorses

Linear and logistic regression for transparent baselines.

Decision trees for human-readable rules.

Random forests for robust general performance on tables.

K-means for quick clustering when you have no labels.

When data grows or patterns get complex, move to gradient boosting or neural networks, but keep the simple baselines for comparison and explanations.

4.4 Gradient boosting (why it wins on spreadsheets)

What it is
Many small decision trees are trained one after another; each new tree focuses on the previous errors. The final prediction aggregates all trees.

Why it works in business data

Handles messy, mixed-type, missing-value tables well.

Strong accuracy with reasonable compute.

Delivers useful feature importance and partial-dependence views for explanations.

How to use it safely

Start with a baseline; tune only a few knobs first: tree depth, learning rate, number of trees.

Watch overfitting; use early stopping on a validation set.

Align evaluation with costs: false positives and false negatives do not cost the same in finance, operations, or healthcare.

4.5 Deep learning in plain language

Neural networks stack simple linear layers and non-linear activations so they can represent very complex functions. With enough data and good training, they learn features automatically rather than you designing them by hand.

Where deep learning shines

Images and video (computer vision)

Text and speech (natural language)

Long streams and sensor data

How it trains
The model makes a prediction, compares it to the target, measures the error (loss), and nudges all weights to reduce that error using gradient descent. Repeat this millions of times on many examples.

Practical tips

Use transfer learning: start from a model trained on huge datasets, then fine-tune on your smaller, specific problem.

Smaller, faster models often beat larger ones in production due to latency and cost.

4.6 Computer vision

Goal
Turn pixels into information: detect defects, count objects, segment regions, read documents.

How it works
Convolutional neural networks slide small filters over the image to detect edges and textures, then combine them into shapes and objects. For localization, object detectors add bounding boxes; for segmentation, each pixel gets a class label.

Production notes

Capture data in the same conditions as deployment (lighting, angle, resolution).

Label carefully; inter-annotator agreement matters more than model tricks.

Track confidence; low-confidence detections go to human review.

4.7 NLP and large language models (LLMs)

Goal
Help with reading, writing, and reasoning over text: summarize, extract fields, answer questions, draft content.

How LLMs represent text

Tokenization breaks text into small pieces.

Embeddings turn tokens into vectors capturing meaning and context.

Self-attention lets the model weigh which earlier tokens matter when predicting the next one.

How to make answers trustworthy

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): search your own sources, then have the model write using those passages, with citations.

Guardrails and policies: define what the assistant can and cannot do, and require human approval for sensitive actions.

4.8 Agentic LLMs

An agent is a loop: plan → call tools → read results → decide next step → stop or ask a human. Agents are useful for multi-step work such as turning an inbox into a task list or compiling a weekly brief.

Good agent design

Clear goals and a checklist of allowed tools.

Logs for every step and decision.

Confidence thresholds and a human handoff path.

Timeouts and a kill-switch to prevent loops.

4.9 Diffusion models, step by step (CLIP → diffusion → guidance)

Why images and video generation looks so good today
Modern image generators combine two big ideas: a shared text–image language for meaning, and a noise-removal process for drawing.

CLIP: a shared language for pictures and words

Two encoders are trained together: one reads text, the other reads images.

Both map their inputs into the same vector space. Matching captions and images end up close together; mismatched pairs are far apart.

After training, a text prompt like “a photo of a cat” becomes a vector that captures its meaning. This vector can condition other models that actually draw the picture.

Diffusion: learn to remove noise until an image appears

Forward process: start from a clean picture and gradually add noise over many steps until it becomes pure static.

Training task: learn a function that, given a noisy image and the step number, predicts the noise to remove.

Sampling (generation): start from random noise and repeatedly apply the learned denoiser in reverse, step by step, to reveal a coherent image.

Guidance: steer the image toward the prompt

Unconditional denoising knows how to make generic, realistic pictures. Conditional denoising uses the text embedding to bias the denoising toward “a cat,” “a red car at night,” and so on.

Classifier-free guidance mixes the two: compute both unconditional and conditional predictions and push the sample in the direction that increases agreement with the text. A guidance scale controls how strongly the prompt steers the image.

Too little guidance yields vague images; too much can overcook details or reduce diversity. Finding the sweet spot is part of production tuning.

How this shows up in products

Text-to-image: prompts become embeddings via CLIP-like text encoders; the diffusion model denoises noise into images aligned with those embeddings.

Image editing: start from your photo, add a bit of noise, and denoise under a new prompt and mask to change only the selected region.

Text-to-video: extend denoising to 3D tensors (time plus height and width) with extra constraints to keep frames consistent.

Operational notes

Safety filters belong before and after generation (prompt and image).

Keep provenance: store prompts, seeds, model version, and guidance parameters for audit and reproducibility.

For speed, use fewer steps with better samplers, distill models, or run smaller models on-prem when privacy or latency matters.
