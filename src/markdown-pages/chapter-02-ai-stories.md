## Household scenarios — “The Saturday Paper Pile”

On Saturdays, Agnė used to sit at the kitchen table with a wobbling pile: bills, school emails, appliance manuals, tax notes. She’d tell herself, “I’m not technical.” A neighbor would happily confirm, “Tech fads come and go—remember when people said we’d never need computers at home, or that the internet was a phase?”

Then one weekend, Agnė tried a small experiment. She opened an AI assistant and asked: “Summarize these five school emails and give me deadlines as a checklist.” It did. Next: “Draft a polite reply to the landlord; keep it under 100 words.” Done. She snapped a photo of a confusing washing-machine manual; the assistant explained the error code and how to fix it. Ten minutes replaced two hours.

Across the street, her friend Marius kept doing Saturdays the old way—copy-pasting, retyping, forgetting, paying a late fee that ate a chunk of the family budget. He wasn’t “bad with tech”; he just assumed change would slow down for him. It didn’t.

Tiny lesson: You don’t need to “be technical.” Start with one recurring annoyance (emails, forms, instructions). Ask an AI tool to summarize → extract deadlines → draft a next step. Save 30–90 minutes a week and reinvest it in something you value.

## Employee perspectives — “The Two Memos”

At the consultancy, Jonas (a senior manager) and I received the same task: write a client memo on supply-chain risks, with a slide appendix. Jonas opened his usual template. I… stalled. I’d been coasting on old habits, telling myself I’d “catch up” on the new tools later. Meanwhile, younger colleagues were shipping work twice as fast. I could feel the gap widening.

Jonas treated AI like a junior analyst. He fed the client brief to an assistant and asked for a first-draft outline with sources to check. He requested three slide variations for the same idea, picked the best logic, and asked for counterarguments to stress-test. He still owned the judgment, but the tool carried the heavy lift. He finished by lunch and spent the afternoon refining.

I tried to brute-force it and fell behind. Finally, I switched gears: I asked the assistant for a risk taxonomy aligned to the client’s sector, a one-page exec summary in plain language, and a checklist for the operations team. I rewrote, verified, and shipped. Not magic—just leverage.

Down the hall, a high-performing colleague refused to try any of this. “Black boxes,” he said. His output stayed good… and then average… and then slow. Performance conversations followed. Nothing dramatic—just opportunity passing by.

Tiny lesson: Use AI to accelerate first drafts, alternatives, and counterarguments—then apply your expertise to edit, verify, and decide. The value isn’t in typing faster; it’s in moving from blank page to better options quickly.

## Business owner examples — “From Assistant to Product”

Ieva was a market research assistant who spent her weeks stitching decks together: copy quotes from articles, paste charts, summarize competitor moves. Her manager praised the hustle, but the work was rinse–repeat. A senior colleague would wink, “Trends are trends. We’ve done it this way for years.” The subtext: tools change, but slides are forever.

Ieva tried a different path. She listed the five tasks she repeated every project: (1) gather sources, (2) extract the same 10 facts (pricing, features, launch dates…), (3) compare competitors, (4) summarize sentiment, (5) draft a one-page brief. She then set up a lightweight workflow around an AI assistant: ingest curated links, pull the same 10 fields, rank changes week-over-week, and draft a brief with caveats—always flagged for human review. She didn’t sell “AI.” She sold Monday Morning Briefs.

She piloted it with two clients as a fixed monthly subscription. Turnaround went from three days per report to two hours, with a human pass to verify quotes and data. Within a quarter, she had six subscribers. The pitch was simple: “Same insights, every Monday, with a red-flag section for anything urgent.” She left to form a tiny company and made the assistant her first product.

Across town, Paulius kept the old model: one-off reports, manual copy-paste, bespoke slides. When inbound requests spiked, he hired interns and slipped on deadlines. Clients started asking for “that weekly brief” they’d seen elsewhere. He doubled down on formatting, not on flow.

Tiny lesson: Pick one repeatable deliverable and productize it. Automate the repeatable 70% (collect → extract → compare → draft), keep human judgment for the last 30%, and package the outcome as a recurring subscription. Don’t sell “AI”; sell faster, more reliable decisions.
